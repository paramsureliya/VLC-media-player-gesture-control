# VLC-media-player-gesture-control

Real-time sign language recognition using computer vision and a trained machine learning model.

## Overview

This project aims to recognize hand gestures in real-time and associate them with VLC media player controls. Users can control VLC media player functions such as play/pause, volume up/down, forward, and backward using specific hand gestures.
